# similarity-checking-from-books
This C++ program identifies the top 10 most similar pairs of textbooks from 64 text files. It preprocesses text by filtering common words and normalizing word frequencies. Similarity indices are computed for each pair using shared frequent words, stored in a 64x64 matrix, excluding self-similarity.
